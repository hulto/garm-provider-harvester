# Sample configuration for the GARM Harvester Provider

# Path to the kubeconfig file for accessing the Harvester cluster.
# If commented out or empty, the provider will attempt to use in-cluster authentication
# (if running inside a Kubernetes pod in the Harvester cluster) or rely on
# environment variables like KUBECONFIG.
# Example: "/home/user/.kube/harvester_config"
# kubeconfig_path = ""

# Specific kubeconfig context to use from the kubeconfig file.
# If commented out or empty, the current context in the kubeconfig will be used.
# Example: "my-harvester-cluster"
# kube_context = ""

# Default Kubernetes namespace where Harvester VMs and related resources
# (like VirtualMachineImages, networks) are managed.
# If commented out or empty, it defaults to "default".
# harvester_namespace = "default"

# Example of other potential settings (currently not implemented in the provider):
# max_instances_per_pool = 10
# default_vm_flavor = "small"
